Lets do some exception handling

Remember this line, you can use in interviews   ---   "exception - Error which you expect"

Lets say we have 2 variables,

a = 10
b = 0

1) try devide a/b, as b is 0, it is going to throw exception, catch it and print it. 
2) Change the value of variables to some string and do the same.
