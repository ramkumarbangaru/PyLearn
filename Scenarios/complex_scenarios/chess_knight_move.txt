imagine a chess board where cells are named with row (numbers) and column(letters)

so each square can be names from a1 to h8.

input to the program would be any square for example, e4. the output of the program should be, possible place a knight can move from here.

so output would be,

d2, f2, c3, g3, c5, g5, d6, f6
