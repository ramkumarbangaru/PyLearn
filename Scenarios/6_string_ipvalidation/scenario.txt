Lets say we have IP as string,

str_ip = "10.12.12.15"

1) Check if given IP is valid or not
2) If Valid find the class it belongs to [class A or B or C ...]

Do not use IP libraries like ipcalc. Perform this using string operations like, split, string compare, slice etc.
If you like, try with reguler expression as well.
