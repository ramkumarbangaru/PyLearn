Lets say we have string called, 

mystr = "example"

1) reverse the string  and print
2) Print 4th character of string [use indexing]
3) Print 3rd character from last [use reverse/negative indexing]
4) take substring from 2nd character to 5th character and print [Use slicing here]
5) take last 3 character of the string and print [Try reverse indexing with slicing here]
